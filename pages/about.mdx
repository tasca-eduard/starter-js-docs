# About 

In the need to help fresh developers in their Frontend Journey, I decided to create a mini-tutorial for Vanilla JS projects. I've found myself repeating the same explanations and I think it's best that newcomers would read this first and try to understand the importante of organizing their code. Of course, after studying the eventual prerequires that are attached in each page.  

**Important**: This is **not** a final documentation and it shouldn't be used in production because it has not been properly adjusted for most use cases.
