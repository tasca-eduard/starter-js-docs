# Creating the Components  

This is pretty straightforward, no need to separate into multiple sections.  

## Overview
Click on the **copy code** on the top right side of the preview to add it in your editor.

Before you even start creating this JS functions, make sure you manually add the markup in the `html` files and style your components. 

Because we are using `innerHTML` property to update the `DOM`, we can create functions that return a string containing your `html` - all of this will be parsed to html.

In each function we will pass the entity and using [String Interpolation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals) in order to dynamically add the data properties that we are interested in.

And there you go, you just created [JSX](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html) :D. Kidding, it's important to get used to this method because popular libraries like ReactJS have this similarity. 

**NOTE**: Just because the returned value is a string, doesn't mean it shouldn't be indented properly. Make sure it's organized the same way you would do in actual `html`.

```js filename="component.js"
function postCardComponent(post) {
  return `
    <a 
      class="article-link" 
      href="#!"
    >
      <article>
        <div class="content">
          <h2>${post.title}</h2>
          </br>
          <p>${post.body}</p>
          </br>
          <small>Click to edit</small>
        </div>            
        <form onsubmit="renderNewPosts(event)">              
          <label>                
            <span>
              Edit Post
            </span>
            <input 
              type="text" 
              name="postTitle" 
              id="postTitle"
              placeholder="Edit post title"
            >              
          </label>              
            <input 
              type="hidden" 
              name="postId" 
              value=${post.id}
            >
            <button type="submit">              
            <span>
              Edit
            </span>
            </button>
        </form>
      </article>
    </a>      
  `
}

function userCardComponent(user) {
  return `
    <article>
      <h2>${user.username}</h2>
      <br>
      <p>${user.name}</p>
      <p>${user.email}</p>
      <p>${user.phone}</p>
    </article>
  `
}
