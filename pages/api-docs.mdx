# Creating the API Calls
We'll be going section by section in order to understand each part. First, let's get used to the overall file.    

Please read about the *"Listing all resources"* and *"Updating a resource"* examples that [JSONPlaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/guide/) provides (if you have not already).  

Also, check the [Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API). We will be using [Async-Await](https://dmitripavlutin.com/javascript-fetch-async-await/) method because the code looks much cleaner and readable. Using chaining with `then` might make use fall into a trap called [Callback Hell](https://www.scaler.com/topics/callback-hell-in-javascript/).


## Overview
For each function, we return the data response so we can use it in the render methods.  
Click on the **copy code** on the top right side of the preview to add it in your editor.

```js filename="api.js" copy
const BASE_API = "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com";
const POSTS_API = "posts";
const USERS_API = "users";

async function listPosts(queryTitle) {
  let endpointUrl = `${BASE_API}/${POSTS_API}`;

  if (queryTitle) {
    endpointUrl += `?title=${queryTitle}`
  }

  const response = await fetch(endpointUrl);
  const posts = await response.json();

  return posts
}

async function listUsers(queryUser) {
  let endpointUrl = `${BASE_API}/${USERS_API}`;

  if (queryUser) {
    endpointUrl += `?username=${queryUser}`;
  }

  const response = await fetch(endpointUrl);
  const users = await response.json();

  return users
}

async function editPost(postTitle, postTitleId) {
  const response = await fetch(`${BASE_API}/${POSTS_API}/${postTitleId}`, {
    method: "PATCH",
    body: JSON.stringify({
      title: postTitle
    })
  })
  const post = await response.json();

  return post
}
```

## Constants
In order to be more flexible or to change a value in the whole project much faster, it's recommended to use constants that will be used in all of our functions.  

```js
const BASE_API = "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com";
const POSTS_API = "posts";
const USERS_API = "users";
``` 

Let's say that JSONPlaceholder will change their url to *"jsonplaceholderawesome"*, then we can easily change our `BASE_API` constant like below:

```js
const BASE_API = "https://jsonplaceholderawesome.typicode.com";
```

Now every `endpointUrl` in our API calls will be up to date.


## List all [Entity]s
Listing all data for an entity is pretty straightforward. We just have to pick our entity, let's say `post`. We use our constant `POSTS_API` and concatenate it to the `BASE_API` and we get the following `endpointUrl`. Don't forget the `async` and `await` keywords.

```js
async function listEntities() {
  let endpointUrl = `${BASE_API}/${[ENTITY]_API}`;
  const response = await fetch(endpointUrl);
  const posts = await response.json();
 
  return postsiu78897
}
```

## List all Entities by Query 
You might have noticed the above function was incomplete compared to the overview file at the beginning. That's because, we can easily add a query param value to search by title in our case. We pass a parameter to our function and add the `?` mark in order to add the value to our endpointUrl. The highlighted code should be added.

```js {1, 4, 5, 6}
async function listEntitiesByQuery(query) {
  let endpointUrl = `${BASE_API}/${[ENTITY]_API}`;
  
  if (query) {
    endpointUrl += `?title=${query}`
  }
  
  const response = await fetch(endpointUrl);
  const posts = await response.json();

  return posts
}
```

## Edit [Entity]
In order to edit an entity it is necessary to have the entity `id` and the value of the property that we are going to change, in our case `title`. The method of this type of request is `PATCH`, meaning that we want to make a partial update.

**NOTE**: To not be mistaken with `PUT` because that should replace the whole entity.  

In response of this request, we will get back the updated entity. We can not change the JSONPlaceholder Database, so the data won't be modified when we request all entities again. We can only "imagine" it is being changed. We can do **persistent local data** if we want, but we will keep that for later or in another article.

```js
async function editPost(postTitle, postTitleId) {
  const response = await fetch(`${BASE_API}/${POSTS_API}/${postTitleId}`, {
    method: "PATCH",
    body: JSON.stringify({
      title: postTitle
    })
  })
  const post = await response.json();

  return post
}
```
