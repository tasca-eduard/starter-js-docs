# Introduction
 
Welcome to Starter JS! This is a basic docs for creating an interactive website. You can use it as a starting point for your own vanilla project :). You'll learn how to fetch from an API, change the DOM (render) and create components for your data.  
We will use JSONPlaceholder (https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) as an example.

## What is Starter JS?

Contains **simple** and **organized** patterns that we can use in order to implement and expand a clean arhitecture that anybody can reuse. It's based on the **separation of concerns** design principle (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns), meaning: each file will address a different concern (problem / functionality) and every function to be reusable as much as possible.  
  
NOTE: We won't focus on the stylings at the moment.
