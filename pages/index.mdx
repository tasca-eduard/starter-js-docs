# Introduction
 
Welcome to Starter JS! This is a basic docs for creating an interactive website. You can use it as a starting point for your own vanilla project :). You'll learn how to fetch from an API, change the DOM (render) and create components for your data.  
We will use JSONPlaceholder (https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) as a server (API) example.

## What is Starter JS? 

Contains **simple** and **organized** patterns that we can use in order to implement and expand a clean arhitecture that anybody can reuse. It's based on the **separation of concerns** design principle (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns), meaning: each file will address a different concern (problem / functionality) and every function to be reusable as much as possible.   
    
## Note 
The projected that is going to be presented was built on the fly without any thoughts to make it public. Please reffer to the **feedback** link if you have any issues or questions.  
For the sake of readability, the events are directly attached to the HTML elements (similar to React, Vue, etc).
Also, we won't focus on the stylings at the moment.
